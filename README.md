## Todo
* Remove ExpressJS from equation and replace file hosting with Node, or stop using FTP hosting.
* [Flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE) setup (first on `launcher.html`)
* Figure out how to do caching

## Notes
* To compile SCSS to CSS, run `sass --watch src/sass:public` in `caeborg-web/client`
* To run Node Server, run `node server/server.js` in `caeborg-web`
* When running `node server/server.js`, it behaves like `server.js` is located in `caeborg-web`, not in `server/`.
