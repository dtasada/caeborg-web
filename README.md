## Todo
* Fix Node Server CSS'ing (file paths?)
* [Flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE) setup (first on `launcher.html`)
* Figure out how to do caching

## Notes
* To compile SCSS to CSS, run `sass --watch src/sass:public` in `caeborg-web/client`
* To run Node Server, run `node client/server.js` in `caeborg-web`
* When running `client/server.js`, it reads files from the directory that the shell command is run in, not from the directory which `client/server.js` is in.
